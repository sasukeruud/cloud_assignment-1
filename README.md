## Assignment task description
First assignment from the cloud technologi class(prog2005-2022).
This program is "develop using REST web application for retriving information about universities that may be candidates for application based on their name, alongside useful contextual information pertaining to the country it is situated in. For this purpose, you will interrogate existing web services and return the result in a given output format." Is the task of the assignment. 

There are two API that are going to be used in the application:

- http://universities.hipolabs.com/
  - Documentation/Source under: https://github.com/Hipo/university-domains-list/

- https://restcountries.com/
  - Documentation/Source under: https://gitlab.com/amatos/rest-countries

The final web service should be deployed on Heroku. The initial development should occur on your local machine. For the submission, you will need to provide both a URL to the deployed Heroku service as well as your code repository.

In the following, you will find the specification for the REST API exposed to the user for interrogation/testing.

## How to run the application
Fastes way to run the application is to run "go run main.go" in the terminal in the main directory.
To build an .exe file(executibale file) you can run the command "go build main.go" in the terminal.
